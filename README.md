### Viewing in Browser

The `make` command also generates `output.html`, which is the HTML version of the markdown file created in the root directory.  You can open this file in your browser to view your project.

### Deploying

_Note: In order to deploy these projects, you need to have SSH access to `adi-website`.  Ask Dan, Nate, Eunice, or Raymond for help setting this up._

Run `make deploy` to deploy your curriculum.  The first time, it will ask for a path slug.  Give something **unique**!
